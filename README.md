# assignment-3

task 1
We  first take the integer input from the user 
then created a factorial function using recursion and if else. 
If n is less than 2 then it will return 1 
else it will call the factorial function again of (n-1) multiplied by n.
Then assign a variable to that result of the function and print it.

task 2
We first take input from the user.
Import all the math function,
then assign a variable to each of required result and print them separately.
